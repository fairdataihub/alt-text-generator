# Alt Image Generator

This project will generate relevant alt text for images using AI.

## How it works

It uses an ML modal from Salesforce called [BLIP](https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP) on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) to generate relevant alt text for images. You can feed the Next.js API route an image as a query param and it will return a one sentence description of that image.

## Running Locally

After cloning the repo, go to [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) to make an account and put your API key in a file called `.env.local`.

Then, run the application in the command line and it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

To use the API route, go to the link below in your browser or run a curl command in your terminal to get a sample result. Feel free to replace the dub.sh link with a link to any image.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/generate?imageUrl=https://dub.sh/confpic
```
